Fast and cryptographically secure random number streams
Tuned rotation constants bring rapid mixing (more than 21 bits avalanche)
Rotation constants switched unpredictably on each round of the generator
Seedable with keys up to 256, 512, or 1024 bits in length
Extremely long periods: Guaranteed to be well in excess of 2**256
The essential RNG can be coded in just 5 lines of C
MOTE has passed the most stringent industry-standard tests: NIST and DIEHARD
Implemented identically in C and Pascal, with full source code and sample programs
Includes the MOTET Cipher & SE Scrambler, a fast encryption program in C
Package includes comprehensive test results for all MOTE variants
Test MOTE yourself: several PRNG test programs are included in the distribution.
